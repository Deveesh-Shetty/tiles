## Set the project locally
- Fork and Clone the project
- This project uses pnpm as a package manager, if you don't have it install it using
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
- Inside both the `client` and  `api/` folder copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required fields.
- Install the dependencies on the client side and run the frontend server
```bash
cd client/
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
- Open a new terminal, and install dependencies and run the backend server
```
cd api/
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
- You can now run the project locally and make changes ðŸ¥³
